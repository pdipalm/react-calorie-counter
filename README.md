### Minimum Requirements

1. Create a new app with create-react-app and store it in a new GitHub repo.

   _As you work on the app, break up your progress into commits with clear messages noting the progress you are making._

2. Use [MUI](https://mui.com/) components and the _Roboto_ font to create the UI for your app. The UI should have the same general structure as the provided example but does not need to exactly match.

3. Implement the CRUD functionality found in the provided example app and persist data in LocalStorage so that users' items are still present after refreshing the page.

4. Host your completed app in GitHub Pages or Netlify so that we can see the finished product and discuss it in your follow-up interview. Share the link to your GitHub repo with us as well.

### Optional Features

Optional features are listed below that you may choose from and implement to set your submission apart from others and demonstrate your more advanced skillset. A preferred candidate will implement at least 2 of these features.

1. Replace LocalStorage with Firestore as a backend database to store the meal items

2. Add Firebase authentication to enable users to sign up and log in/out of the app

3. Use TypeScript to add static typechecking to the app

4. Use a GitHub Action or Netlify Automatic Deploy to automatically update your hosted app when you push changes to GitHub

5. Add tests. Use Cypress if you choose to add end-to-end tests.
